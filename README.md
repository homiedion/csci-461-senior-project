## Features

### User Registration
Users can create their own account within the application.

### GPS Map
Registered users can view a map provided by OpenLayers.

### Crowdsourced Animal Tracking
Registered users can create and view waypoints on the map. These waypoints mark the location of a specific type of animal using an icon the creator selected.

## Planned Features

### Animal Filtering
Users will be able to filter the displayed waypointed based on the animal type.

### User Profile
Users will have a profile that allows them to edit their account settings and manage waypoints they have made.

### Email Confirmation
Potential Users will recieve an email address when they sign up. To complete the registration process the user will have to input a code sent to their email address.

### Waypoint Ratings
Users will be able to upvote or downvote a waypoint based on whether or not they saw it. Using either will modify the remaining time left on the waypoint. Each user can only vote once per waypoint.
